#### Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The goal of this project was to allow for easy and intuitive analysis of data relating to bikeshare schemes across three cities; New York City, Chicago and Washington. To do this, I used Pandas DataFrames and created multiple python functions to allow a user to interact with the data more easily.

### Files used
The files I used were as follows:

washington.csv
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
bikeshare.py

### Credits
For this project, I did not use any external resources, however, for the GitHub work I must thank Udacity and the following repository:
