## Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The goal of this project was to allow for easy and intuitive analysis of data relating to bikeshare schemes across three cities; New York City, Chicago and Washington. To do this, I used Pandas DataFrames and created multiple python functions to allow a user to interact with the data more easily.


### Files used
The files I used were as follows:

washington.csv 
chicago.csv 
new_york_city.csv 
bikeshare.py

### Credits
I forked the following repository to create this file and publish to github:
